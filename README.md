# 💊 Drug Sales Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Description
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of **drug sales performance** across multiple dimensions such as revenue, profit, customer demographics, and geography.  
The dataset included details on drug sales transactions, customer profiles, and buying behavior.  

After cleaning and preparing the data, I used **Power BI** to build interactive dashboards highlighting business KPIs like revenue trends, profit margins, top/bottom performing drugs, and customer insights.  

Key takeaways include:  
- Total revenue: **$64.67M**  
- Average monthly revenue: **$6M** (↑12.8% in May)  
- Profit margin: **81.76%** with **$5M profit** in May
